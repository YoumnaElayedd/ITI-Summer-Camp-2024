*House Prices Prediction – Kaggle Competition

This repository contains my solution to the House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques competition on Kaggle, completed during my training at the Information Technology Institute (ITI).

📚 Overview
As part of my training, I worked on a complete machine learning pipeline to predict house prices. This project helped me apply various data preprocessing and modeling techniques, with a focus on improving model performance.

💡 What I Learned
🧹 Data Cleaning
Handling missing values, fixing data types, and treating outliers.

🏗️ Feature Engineering & Selection
Selecting meaningful features and applying One-Hot Encoding to convert categorical variables into numerical format.

🔄 Data Transformation
Scaling, encoding, and transforming skewed data to improve model quality.

📊 Modeling & Evaluation

Used Linear Regression as the primary model.

Applied multiple steps to improve training results, such as feature tuning and validation.

Evaluated model using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

🛠 Tools & Libraries Used
Python

pandas, numpy

scikit-learn

matplotlib, seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

🔍 Project Workflow
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Identified patterns, correlations, and potential data issues.

Preprocessing

Handled missing values using strategies like mean/median fill or treating them as a separate category.

Encoded categorical data using One-Hot Encoding.

Transformed skewed features for better model performance.

Model Training

Trained a Linear Regression model.

Applied cross-validation and fine-tuned features to improve performance.
